        <p>This stew seems primitive with its, fresh herbs, root vegetables, berries, mushrooms, and meat. All things <br>
            available to the Vikings with earthy flavor and works with any meats so don't be discouraged if you can't <br>
            find a wild boar, the dish will still be delicious.
