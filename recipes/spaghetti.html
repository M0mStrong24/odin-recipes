             <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons red chili flakes,or to taste</li>
                <li>6 onces dry spaghetti</li>
                <li> salt to taste</li>

             </ul>
             <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Gather all of the needed ingredients</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until it becomes fragrant and the color becomes golden, about 1 minute.
                    <br>Stir in tomato puree, water, and salt.Bring to a simmer on medium-high heat. Once simmering, reduce to low heat and keep warm.
                <li>Pour olive oil into a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, season with chili flakes(if desired) until they start to sizzle, for 1 minute.<br>
                    Add raw spaghetti and toss until well coated with chili oil(you can add different seasonings for flavor besides spice).</li>
                <li>Pour in about 3 cups of tomato broth, then with tongs move the pasta from side to side to evenly distribute the tomato broth.<br>
                    Cook, occasionally moving the pasta from side to side with tongs, keep the noodles facing the same direction, until most of the broth has been absorbed or evaporated.<br>
                    The noodles will start to fry, allow it.</li>
                <li>Turn spaghetti over with tongs, spread evenly in the pan and allow the pasta to brown or even lightly char.</li>
                <li>Add about 2 more cups of the tomato broth, and repeat the process(move back and fourth with tongs, absorb, spread, brown or char).<br>
                    Cook to your desired doneness and if you want your dish saucy you can add more broth or relatively dry.</li>
                </ol>
